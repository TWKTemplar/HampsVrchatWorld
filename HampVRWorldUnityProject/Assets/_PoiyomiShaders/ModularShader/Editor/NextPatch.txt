[ThryToggleUI(true)] _TPSDepthMaskEnabled ("<size=13><b>  TPS Depth Enabled</b></size>", Float) = 0
_TPSMaskStrength ("Mask Strength--{condition_showS:(_TPSDepthMaskEnabled==1)}", Range(0,1)) = 1
float TPSMaskStrength;
#ifdef TPS_Penetrator
	if (_TPSDepthMaskEnabled)
	{
		clearCoatMask = lerp(clearCoatMask, 1, TPSBufferedDepth(poiMesh.localPos, poiMesh.vertexColor) * _TPSMaskStrength);
	}
