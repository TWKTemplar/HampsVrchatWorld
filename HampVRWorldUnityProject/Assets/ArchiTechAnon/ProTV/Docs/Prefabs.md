## ProTV Classic
This prefab is a mesh-less variation. It uses no "physical" models, just a quad for the screen. It comes with the Classic Controls plugin. Great for prototyping in worlds or using as a starting point for a custom implementation.

Here's what it looks like playing a video:

## ProTV Hangout
This plugin contains a UI designed to sit in front of the tv screen. It uses animations for visibility and add parts of the Classic Controls with a combination panel of a Queue and a Playlist with a more minimalist visual style. In this prefab, the Playlist has been setup to add entries to the queue instead of just immediately playing them. It also integrates the new VoteSkip plugin with a button on the queue tab for skipping the current video in the queue.

Here's what it looks like:
